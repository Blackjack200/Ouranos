# Ouranos - Minecraft Bedrock Edition Proxy

**Status:** Work In Progress (WIP)

Ouranos is a proxy for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that allows players using lower client versions to connect to higher server versions. It serves as a bridge to ensure compatibility between different Minecraft versions, enabling seamless connections across versions that wouldn't normally be able to interact.

**Known Issues:**
- **CreativeContentsPacket crash**: Currently, there is an issue with the `CreativeContentsPacket` that causes the client to crash. We are working on a fix.
- **Other potential compatibility issues**: As this project is still a work in progress, there may be other bugs or limitations. Please report any issues on our GitHub page.

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repository to your server machine.
2. Follow the setup instructions (TBD, will be added soon).
3. Ensure the correct version of Minecraft Bedrock Edition is set up for the proxy.
4. Run the proxy, and players with lower client versions should be able to connect to your server.

**Contributing:**
We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to help improve the project, please feel free to submit pull requests or report bugs.
